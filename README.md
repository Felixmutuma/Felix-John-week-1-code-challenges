- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.



## Speed Detector

### Description
This program takes a number as input i.e the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
